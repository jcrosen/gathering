This is a simple ruby application that allows a user to create a "Gathering" of a specific type (Wedding, Party, etc.), manage an invitation list and allow invited persons to confirm their attendance via some form of input.

This application has also been a learning experience/experiment to decouple the application specific business logic from the implementation details according to the design paradigm set forth in Robert Martin's presentation "Architecture: The Lost Years".  Please see the doc/credits file for details on who specifically has contributed to the completion of this project.
